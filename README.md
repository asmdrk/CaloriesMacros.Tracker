## Calories and Nutrition Tracker

FAQ:
- What does it do?

This application essentially allows you to enter the nutritional information of whatever you eat throughout the day, 
and keeps track of your total calories and macros.

- Who actually wants this?

Anyone who is interested in controlling their diet, whether for weight loss, or to suppplement a training program. 
It is also useful for people with medical issues, for example if you need to eat more carbs to combat 
low blood pressure.

- Why did you make this?

I have been extremely into fitness and working out for a long time, and with that comes the unavoidable need to 
control what you eat on a day-to-day basis. Thus, making an application which helps you do that is not only a fun 
project, but also something that I can use in my life!
